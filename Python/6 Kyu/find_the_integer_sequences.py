# Description:

# Complete function findSequences. It accepts a positive integer n. Your task is to find such integer sequences:

# Continuous positive integer and their sum value equals to n

# For example, n = 15 
# valid integer sequences:
# [1,2,3,4,5]  (1+2+3+4+5==15)
# [4,5,6]          (4+5+6==15)
# [7,8]              (7+8==15)

# The result should be an array [sequence 1,sequence 2...sequence n], sorted by ascending order of the length of sequences; If no result found, return [].
# Some examples:


# findSequences(3) === [[1,2]]

# findSequences(15) === [[7,8],[4,5,6],[1,2,3,4,5]]

# findSequences(20) === [[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]]

# findSequences(100) === [[18, 19, 20, 21, 22], [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]]

# findSequences(1) === []
